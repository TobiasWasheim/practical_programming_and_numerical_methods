Part 1: Maximum/Minimum representable Integers
Largest Integer = 2147483647
Smallest Integer = -2147483648

largestInteger == INT32_MAX  1
smallestInteger == INT32_MIN 1

Part 2: The Machine Epsilon
Machine epsilon for double-precision: 2.22045e-16
Machine epsilon for double-precision (correct): 2.22045e-16
Machine epsilon for float-precision:  1.19209e-07
Machine epsilon for float-precision (correct): 1.19209e-07

Part 3:
a == b ? 0
a > 1 ?  0
b > 1 ?  1

Explanation:
Since epsilon is the smallest representation of the value between 1.0 and the next. So
when we define tiny as epsilon/2, the program sees tiny as equal to zero.

Part 3:Tiny Epsilon
a == b ? 0
a > 1 ?  0
b > 1 ?  1

Explanation:
Since epsilon is the smallest representation of the value between 1.0 and the next. So
when we define tiny as epsilon/2, the program sees tiny as equal to zero.

Part 4: Comparing Doubles
Compare d1 and d2: 1
