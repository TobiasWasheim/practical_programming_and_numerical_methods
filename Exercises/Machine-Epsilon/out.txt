Part 1: Maximum/Minimum representable Integers
Largest Integer = 2147483647
Smallest Integer = -2147483648

The largest integer we have calculated is the largest 32-bit integer that is possible.
The smallest integer we have calculated is the smallest 32-bit integer that is possible.

Part 2: The Machine Epsilon
Machine epsilon for double-precision: 2.22045e-16  The correct value: 2.22045e-16
Machine epsilon for float-precision:  1.19209e-07  The correct value: 1.19209e-07

Part 3:
a == b ? 0
a > 1 ?  0
b > 1 ?  1

Explanation:
Since epsilon is the smallest representation of the value between 1.0 and the next. So
when   we define tiny as epsilon/2, the program sees tiny as equal to zero.

Part 3:Tiny Epsilon
a == b is not true
a > 1 is not true
b > 1 is true

Explanation:
Since epsilon is the smallest representation of the value between 1.0 and the next. So
when adding epsilon/2 to 1.0, the program considers that as equal to 1.0

Part 4: Comparing Doubles
d1 and d2 are equal
