### Description
This program outputs the calculations:
- sqrt(2)
- 2^(1/5)
- e^(\pi)
- (\pi)^e
using the cmath header. For part 2 and and 3 we have computed the gammafunction Î“(n) for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and the logarithm of the gamma function. 

The calculations using cmath header and the table can be seen in the file "output.txt".

### Makefile
- By entering "make" into the command prompt you assemble the program. It creates a txt file called "output.txt" with the output of the program. 

- By entering "make clean" into the command prompt, all the object, header and output files are removed.W

All files are sorted into headers, objects and source files and can be viewed in their folder.
