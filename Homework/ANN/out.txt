Homework: ANN - part A
-------------------------------------------

In part A, the artifical neural network (ANN) has been
implemented. To test it, we try to interpolate the function

f(x) = cos(5x - 1) exp(-x^2),

We have plotted the interpolation and the function on the plot at
plots/partA.svg where we see that the neural network fits quite well.

Since the minimization function from the homework 'Min' is unstable,
there has been implemented the quasi-Newton method using symmetic Broyden's update.

Homework: ANN - part B
-------------------------------------------

In part b, we have implemented the first, second, and anti-derivative of 
a function fitted in the neural network. Since the function in part A
does not have an anti-derivative that is easy to find analytically, we
resort to a much simpler function to showcase that the derivatives work
that are estimated from the neural network. This should however, not be an
issue, since we would expect that if the derivatives fit for a simpler function
it should also fit for more interesting functions. We use the function

f(x) = cos(2x)

We can see that the first derivative fits quite well in the plot at plots/first_derivative.svg/.
Also, the second derivative also fits nicely compared to the analytical solution. This can
be seen on the plot at plots/second_derivative.svg/. At last, we have also plotted the anti-derivative
for the cosine-function at plots/anti_derivative.svg/. We see here compared to the analytical result it
it is similar. To clarify the integral: The integral we have plotted is the integral of cos(2x') from 0 to x.
This integral has the analytical solution 0.5 * sin(2x).
