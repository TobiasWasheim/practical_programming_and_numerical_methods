Homework: Monte Carlo - part A
---------------------------------------------

In part A I have implemented the plain Monte 
Carlo integration method. To test that it    
works, I have calculated the area of the     
unit circle and the area under the Gaussian  
function. The plots for the integral value   
and error with the number of points on the   
x-axis. They can seen in the folder plots/.  
The error for both the unit circle area and  
integral value of the Gaussian function goes 
as 1/sqrt(N).                                
The integral values goes towards the exact   
value as N increases.                        

Lastly, the 3D integral given in the bottom  
for part A can be seen on the plots          
plots/functionError.svg and                  
plots/functionValue.svg.

Homework: Monte Carlo - part B
---------------------------------------------

In part B I have implemented the quasi-      
random Monte Carlo integral method. I've     
used the Van der Corput sequence and to      
find the error, I have used to different     
bases and subtracted the integral values     
that are made up from the two bases.         
Comparing the method to the plain MC method  
for N = 1000 points we get that              

Plain MC unit circle area = 3.188
Quasi MC unit circle area = 3.14
Plain MC unit circle error = 0.0508788
Quasi MC unit circle error = 0.0113137

The exact value is 3.14... so for the quasi- 
random Monte Carlo method we are close to the
value and it also has a lower estimated error
than the plain Monte Carlo method.
