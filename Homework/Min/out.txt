Homework: Minimization - part A
-------------------------------------------

In part A, Newton's method for minimization has been implemented
and tested using the Rosenbrock- and Himmelblau function.
For the rosenbrock function

f(x,y) = (a - x)^2 + b (y - x^2)^2,

the minimum is at (a,a^2). I have choosen a = 5 and b = 100.
Below you can see the minimum point that is computed numerically
using Newton's minimization method.
4.95802
24.582
The number of iterations to find the minimum is 910.
The himmelbalu function

f(x,y) = (x^2 + y - 11)^2 + (x + y^2 - 7)^2,

has five extremum points. We are going to find the point
(-0.27,-0.92) numerically. The numerical point can be seen below.
-0.270837
-0.922994
The number of iterations to find the minimum is 5282.
As we see, the numerical values are close to the analytical ones.

Homework: Minimization - part B
-------------------------------------------

In part B, the data for the Higgs-boson has been fitted
to determine its mass, decay width, and scale factor.
These are the following:

m = 125.972 GeV, Î“ = 2.08636 GeV, and A = 9.87629

Additionally, the fit is plotted with the experimental data
and can been seen at the folder plots/.
