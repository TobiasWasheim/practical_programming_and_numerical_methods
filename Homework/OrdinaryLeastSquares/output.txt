Homework: Ordinary Least Squares - part A
-----------------------------------------

In part A we have implemented ordinary   
least squares fit using QR-decomposition.
To show that it works we have fitted the 
data from measurements of ThX activity.  

The plot of the measurements can be seen 
in the folder 'plots/'. Using OLS the    
fitting coefficients are                 

ln(a) = 142.404,
lambda: 0.170624.
The half-life of ThX from the fitting is 

T_(1/2) = 4.06242 days.

The modern value is 3.66 days.

Homework: Ordinary Least Squares - part B
-----------------------------------------

In part B we have modified the ordinary  
least least squares method to calculate  
and return the covariance matrix. The    
uncertainty on the fitting coefficients  
are                                      

log(a) uncertainty = 0.0012533
Lambda uncertainty = 5.12172e-05

The uncertainty for the half-life is    

T_(1/2) uncertainty = 0.00121944days.

The modern half-life uncertainty for ThX 
is 0.0014 days. Comparing the modern value
Comparing the modern value for the half  
-life from the fit and its uncertainty we
see that that the values does not agree  
within the estimated uncertainty.
