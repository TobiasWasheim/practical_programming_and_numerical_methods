Homework: Splines - part A
-------------------------------------------

In part A, I have implemented the interpolation
 for the linear spline and the integral.
To see that it works I have plotted the function
and its integral for

f(x) = cos(x)

Which can be seen  at 'plots/lspline.svg'

Homework: Splines - part B
-------------------------------------------

In part B the quadratic spline has been implemented.
To see that it works I have plotted the same
function as for part A. It can be seen at 'plots/qspline.svg
